title: 'v17 Editor experience: A \{\=template\} for success'
info: |
  Editor experience isn’t just a nice-to-have — it’s what makes or breaks your build. With the arrival of the first LTS using the new backoffice, we're seeing fresh possibilities to shape more intuitive and delightful editing environments. But with great innovation (hello Bellissima!) comes the loss of old comforts (farewell AngularJS).

  We'll explore how developers can craft richer editor experiences using blocks, templated labels, and the newly-minted Umbraco Flavored Markdown (UFM) as well as some custom views and project-specific extensions.

  Whether you're wrangling complex content models or just tired of grumpy editors, this session will help you build backoffices that are thoughtful and elegant without sacrificing structure or sanity.
